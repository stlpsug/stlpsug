# Glenn Sarti

## Synopsis
"With a penchant for DevOps, Puppet, Neo4j or anything Windows related."

## Description
I’m originally from Perth (Western Australia), but in December 2015, my family and I made the big move to Portland (Oregon, United States), where I now work at Puppet as Senior Software Developer on the Agent and Platform Team.

I have spent well over a decade as a Windows Client and Infrastructure engineer, with a heavy focus on automation and infrastructure software development. I was also a co-organiser for the DevOps meetup in Perth and have spoken at the Perth Dot Net, Java and DevOps meetups and Portland Powershell User Group.

I’m also a contributor to Neo4j, helping out with management of Neo4j on Windows.
