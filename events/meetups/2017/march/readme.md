# Investigating Vester

## March 2017 w/ Brian Bunke

Vester provides configuration management for your VMware environment by leveraging the PowerCLI and Pester modules.

[The recording is on YouTube!](https://youtu.be/6DYZR-xFt-4) Sorry I went a bit long :slightly_frowning_face:, but you can speed it up or skip ahead now :wink:

This live demo accompanies the three-part blog series.

This demo contains the following files, which I stored in the `$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\Demo\` directory:

- `Vester1.ps1`
    - A brief intro to Pester
    - Introducing `Try`/`Catch` as a remediation mechanic
- `Vester2.ps1`
    - Follows along with [Introducing Vester](http://www.brianbunke.com/blog/2017/03/07/introducing-vester/)
- `Vester3.ps1`
    - Follows along with [Vester 2: Vest Harder](http://www.brianbunke.com/blog/2017/03/08/vester-2-vest-harder/)
- `Power-State.Vester.ps1`
    - The end result of [Write Your Own Vester Test](http://www.brianbunke.com/blog/2017/03/09/write-your-own-vester-test/)
