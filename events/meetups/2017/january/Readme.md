# Getting Started with PowerShell
## STLPSUG January 2017 

This presentation used the [Lability PowerShell Module](https://github.com/VirtualEngine/Lability) and [@absolutejam's blog](http://www.absolutejam.co.uk/blog/lability-ultimate-hyperv-lab-tool/) to get rolling.
You can see the outputs in the [`Config.ps1`](./Config.ps1) and [`Data.psd1`](./Data.psd1) files.

I wasn't able to get the portion where the lab installs Chocolatey and Nginx, then sets the Nginx service to the correct state, to work.
I'll try to follow up on this later so that you can just run the command and get straight to work.

Sorry!
